Nice to meet you! I'm a software developer, originally from Perth, Australia, but presently based in Tokyo, Japan. I love writing code for Apple's platforms, with my main passion being writing highly-performant, pixel perfect user interfaces. Previously, I worked as an iOS software engineer at [Mercari](https://mercari.jp) and as a Cocoa product engineer/evangelist at [Realm](https://realm.io) on their Cocoa platforms . 👨🏼‍💻

In my free time, I love to work on my comic reader app [iComics](http://icomics.co) where I'm currently starting a complete rewrite in Swift. Besides that, I love playing video games (Splatoon 2 and Destiny 2 are my current jams!), and being in Japan, I love singing karaoke. 🎉
