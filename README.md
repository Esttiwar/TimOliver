I'm a software developer, originally from Perth, Australia, but presently based in Tokyo, Japan. I love writing code for Apple's platforms, with my main passion being writing highly-performant, pixel perfect user interfaces.

I also love participating in the worldwide Apple developers community and have presented at, and help host a variety of conferences and meetups around the world.

On my GitHub account, I've published a variety of iOS component libraries and other general iOS/macOS utilities. I love open source on GitHub as it enables all developers to benefit from each others' work, letting us all create better things faster.

## Work

I've worked as an iOS software engineer full-time since 2013. My more recent roles were:

* [Mercari](https://mercari.jp) - I was a tech lead for 3 feature teams on the company's flagship iOS product. I was also a communications lead, helping to facilitate team building between the Japanese and Western employees whenever language barriers arose.
* [Realm](https://realm.io) - I was a Product Engineer for Realm's Cocoa product. I helped add features to Realm itself, produced a variety of auxiliary libraries, and helped evangelise the product at a variety of events.

## Values

* Give more than you take.
* Share knowledge. No two minds have the same contents.
* Treat others how you wish to be treated.
